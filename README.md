## Project Structure (Atomic Design)

The project follows the Atomic Design pattern, organizing components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages for better maintainability and scalability.

- **Atoms**: The smallest building blocks, such as buttons and input fields.

- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms, forming more complex components like forms.

- **Organisms**: Groups of molecules, creating larger components like a book item.

- **Pages**: Assemble templates, forming complete pages of the application.
